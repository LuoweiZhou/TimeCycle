# TimeCycle

Code for [Learning Correspondence from the Cycle-consistency of Time (CVPR 2019, Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07593). The code is developed based on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework. This repo includes the training code for learning semi-dense correspondence from unlabeled videos, and testing code for applying this correspondence on segmentation mask tracking in videos.

Our trained model can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/txsj62dp9nuxs6h/checkpoint_14.pth.tar?dl=0). The tracking performance on DAVIS-2017 for this model (without training on DAVIS-2017) is:

| J_mean | J_recall | J_decay | F_mean | F_recall | F_decay |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.419 | 0.409 | 0.272 | 0.394 | 0.336 | 0.328 |

The training and testing procedures for this model are described as follows.

## Dataset Preparation

Please read [`DATASET.md`](DATASET.md) for downloading and preparing the VLOG dataset for training and DAVIS dataset for testing.

## Training
Replace the input list in train_video_cycle_simple.py in the home folder as:
```Shell
    params['filelist'] = 'YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/vlog_frames_12fps.txt'
```
Then run the following code:
```Shell
    python train_video_cycle_simple.py --checkpoint pytorch_checkpoints/release_model_simple
```

## Testing
Replace the input list in test_davis.py in the home folder as:
```Shell
    params['filelist'] = 'YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/davis/DAVIS/vallist.txt'
```
Set up the dataset path YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER in run_test.sh . Then run the testing and evaluation code together:
```Shell
    sh run_test.sh
```
Note that one can easily improve the results by increasing the "cropSize" in the script.
